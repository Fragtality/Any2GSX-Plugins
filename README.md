## 4 - Available Aircraft Profiles

| Aircraft | Author | Description |
| :-------------- | :---------: | :----------- |
| Fenix A320 Native | Fragtality | Profile to enhance Fenix native Integration (so use the EFB to load via GSX!) and Volume Control without Fenix2GSX |
| Fenix A320 PilotsDeck | Fragtality | Profile only enabling PilotsDeck Integration - to be used together with Fenix2GSX |
| FlyByWire A32NX | Fragtality | Profile enabling GSX Automation & Volume Control for the A320. Fuel, Payload and Equipment is perfectly handled by the Aircraft itself! (All other Aircraft Developers: Do *THAT* first, then build the Automation on Top) |
| FlyByWire A380X | Fragtality | Profile enabling GSX Automation & Volume Control for the A380. Fuel, Payload and Equipment is perfectly handled by the Aircraft itself! (All other Aircraft Developers: Do *THAT* first, then build the Automation on Top) |

## 4 - What about ... ?

### PMDG B737

At the Moment it is just not possible to do anything on the same Level as the B777 - *maybe* when the UFT was updated.<br/>
Even then the Issue is: I don't own and won't buy the 737 - it is just not my Cup of Tea (the Aircraft itself, doesn't make a difference who's the Addon Dev). When asking for a free Copy of the Aircraft (limited by Time or other means of course) PMDG went silent.<br/>
So I won't say never, but the Chances aren't looking good at the Moment.

<br/><br/>

### Deeper Integration with iniBuilds Aircrafts

Don't hope for anything. Or count on the Fact that I can continue "trick" the native Integration of the A350 in the Future.<br/>
iniBuilds just doesn't show any Interest. When asking how to get in Touch with the Developers, the Discord Mods send you to Support and Support then parks your Ticket on /dev/null.

<br/><br/>

### FSLabs

Remains to be seen / under Investigation.<br/>
The Thing is: the whole 2GSX Journey began becaused I missed the Stuff FSLabs did in P3D when using the Fenix in MSFS (admittedly, it grew *a bit* bigger than that :sweat_smile:). And back then I did not miss much, I just enhanced it a little (i.e. calling Jetways at Session Start and running MCDU Macros to trigger Services).<br/>
Since I don't own it, I can't really assess if something needs to be done or can be done. So there is a slight Chance of me saying "Nah, that's fine!" - I don't mind their Use of the flawed Remote Control Mode. I have the GSX Menu on my StreamDeck and know the Variable to disable Remote Control. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
